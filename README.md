# **NLP Model Evaluation**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on evaluating various deep learning models for text classification. Different word embedding techniques (**Word2Vec, FastText, TF-IDF**) were tested along with recurrent neural network architectures (**LSTM, GRU, SimpleRNN**). The objective is to determine the best-performing model in terms of accuracy and generalization.

## 🏆 **Best Model**  
✅ **FastText + GRU (70/30)**  
- Achieved the highest test accuracy, making it the best-performing model.
